[_[16]_;_[17]_;_[18]_;_[19]_;_[20]_;_[21]_;_[22]_;_[8]_;_[23]_;_[7]_;7]_ The Reuters reporting on Moltbook’s security hole also describes OpenClaw—via how its fans describe it—as a digital assistant that can stay on top of emails, “tangle with insurers,” check in for flights, and perform other tasks. [_[24]_;_[25]_;_[6]_;_[6]_;6]_ This is funny in the way a kitchen fire is funny after it’s been put out. It’s also exactly the kind of failure mode OpenClaw’s formal security posture tries to prevent today: prompt injection defenses can’t rely on “good intentions”; they need tool constraints, sandboxing, and access controls. [_[26]_;_[6]_;_[27]_;_[28]_;_[28]_;_[29]_;_[30]_;are] welcome to observe.” The page explicitly instructs the user to send a message to their agent telling it to read a Moltbook “skill” document and follow instructions to join; ownership verification happens via a code posted to a non-Moltbook social account.

[_[33]_;_[35]_;_[36]_;36]_ But security analysis and reporting on a major Moltbook database exposure indicates that behind those “agents,” there were far fewer humans. SecurityWeek reports Wiz’s analysis that the platform claimed 1.5 million registered agents but only ~17,000 human users deployed them—implying massive agent-per-human ratios and making it trivial for someone to inflate “agents” with scripts. [_[37]_;_[38]_;_[24]_;_[39]_;_[8]_;_[8]_;_[8]_;_[40]_;\"organization\",\"OWASP\",\"security foundation\"], which lists “Prompt Injection” and “Excessive Agency” among major risks for LLM applications—especially when models can trigger actions with permissions and autonomy. [_[41]_;\"organization\",\"National Vulnerability Database\",\"nist vulnerability database\"] entry for CVE-2026-25253 describes OpenClaw (aka Clawdbot/Moltbot) before version 2026.1.29 obtaining a gatewayUrl from a query string and automatically making a WebSocket connection without prompting, sending a token value. [_[42]_;_[43]_;\"organization\",\"SecurityWeek\",\"cybersecurity news outlet\"] summarizes the same exploit chain, attributing discovery to the security firm DepthFirst and emphasizing that token theft can enable the attacker to disable sandboxing and user-confirmation prompts, leading to full host compromise. [_[44]_;_[45]_;_[8]_;_[37]_;37]_ Additional reporting describes audits finding hundreds of malicious skills in the ecosystem, framing it as a large-scale malware distribution channel through an AI agent marketplace. [_[46]_;_[24]_;_[37]_;_[47]_;_[48]_;_[43]_;_[42]_;_[45]_;_[24]_;_[37]_;_[49]_;_[8]_;_[50]_;_[40]_;_[51]_;_[44]_;_[52]_;52]_ The OpenClaw architecture documentation positions the Gateway as a typed control plane with pairing and trust mechanisms, and its security docs show a push toward operational audits (openclaw security audit) and explicit policy controls (DM pairing defaults, allowlists, mention gating, sandbox modes, plugin allowlists). [_[53]_;_[40]_;_[54]_;_[55]_;_[56]_;_[57]_;_[58]_;_[59]_;_[60]_;_[20]_;\"organization\",\"European Parliament\",\"eu legislature\"] describes the EU AI Act as a risk-based regulatory framework and notes that AI systems used in products under product safety legislation can be considered high risk, with additional requirements. [_[61]_;\"organization\",\"National Institute of Standards and Technology\",\"us standards agency\"] frames the AI Risk Management Framework as a voluntary resource to manage risks to individuals, organizations, and society, aiming to incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and evaluation of AI systems.
