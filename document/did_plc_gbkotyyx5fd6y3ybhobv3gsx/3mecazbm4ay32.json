[__[3]__;__[4]__;4]__ The same research finds 23% more searches nationally for gambling addiction help-seeking following the 2018 decision. [__[5]__;__[6]__;__[7]__;__[8]__;8]__ That scale buys everything: more marketing, more product iteration, better pricing tolerance, and a bigger database of behavior to optimize retention. A Reuters analysis even frames the FanDuel/DraftKings advantage as self-reinforcing: the leaders have more resources to spend on marketing and development, which helps them stay leaders. [__[9]__;__[10]__;__[11]__;__[12]__;__[13]__;13]__ This followed the early termination of PENN Entertainment's ESPN BET agreement, which Reuters and AP covered as a notable unwind of a high-profile media-betting partnership. [__[14]__;__[15]__;__[16]__;16]__ It also projects higher profit in 2026 (net revenue guidance and EBITDA guidance reported in Reuters coverage). [__[17]__;__[18]__;18]__ That partnership matters less for “integrity vibes” and more because it gives legitimacy, content hooks, and marketing channels. [__[19]__;__[20]__;__[21]__;__[22]__;__[23]__;__[24]__;__[25]__;__[26]__;__[27]__;__[28]__;__[29]__;29]__ The decision explicitly reflects the state-federal tension: Kalshi argues CFTC jurisdiction; the state argues it’s unlicensed wagering, including concerns about state-level age restrictions. [__[29]__;__[30]__;__[31]__;__[32]__;__[33]__;__[34]__;34]__ Reuters later reported Polymarket received a “green signal” from the CFTC to relaunch in the U.S., highlighting the acquisition and regulatory relief via a no-action letter on certain requirements. [__[35]__;__[36]__;36]__ (And yes, the timing means “Super Bowl contracts” were part of the immediate practical stakes of these orders, as covered in industry reporting about the Nevada action. [__[37]__;__[38]__;__[39]__;__[40]__;40]__ Barron’s reporting has also framed Robinhood’s prediction market activity as meaningfully tied to football season performance—suggesting real revenue sensitivity to sports-event trading. [__[41]__;__[42]__;__[43]__;__[44]__;44]__ Reuters also reported Nevada’s court actions and the broader trend of state-level pushback, including mention of Coinbase being temporarily blocked in Nevada in related prediction market disputes. [__[29]__;__[45]__;45]__ FanDuel’s own product page states the contracts are listed by CME derivatives exchanges and regulated by the CFTC, with accounts opened via a registered futures commission merchant and membership in the National Futures Association. [__[46]__;__[47]__;47]__ On Super Bowl week, DraftKings announced an agreement with Crypto.com’s U.S. derivatives arm to broaden prediction markets available through DraftKings Predictions, including player-specific sports contracts. [__[48]__;__[49]__;__[8]__;8]__ Reuters analysis in 2025 cited estimates from H2 Gambling Capital putting FanDuel and DraftKings far ahead of the pack in operator gross wins share. [__[9]__;__[9]__;__[19]__;__[50]__;__[51]__;51]__ The Wall Street Journal has reported that in states that break out bet types, parlays can constitute a minority of wagers but a majority of revenue—an illustration of why operators market them aggressively. [__[52]__;__[10]__;__[53]__;__[54]__;__[55]__;55]__ The same AGA release cites confusion over regulatory oversight: 78% think state regulators could help resolve disputes, despite prediction markets operating outside state sports betting frameworks. [__[55]__;__[56]__;__[57]__;__[58]__;__[59]__;59]__ The same fact sheet states NCPG’s estimate of the annual national social cost of problem gambling as $14 billion. [__[59]__;__[5]__;__[60]__;__[61]__;__[62]__;__[63]__;__[64]__;__[65]__;65]__ It also notes an increase in sports wagering participation (from ~15% to ~19% in that survey context). [__[65]__;__[66]__;__[67]__;__[68]__;68]__ And investigative reporting has suggested gambling branding can appear with extremely high frequency during sports events, amplifying exposure even if the national “share of total TV ads” sounds modest. [__[69]__;__[70]__;__[32]__;32]__ The AGA’s survey framing—whether you like the AGA or not—quantifies how that messaging lands: people describe it as investing more often, and they believe state regulators have oversight when they don’t. [__[55]__;__[71]__;71]__ Crypto.com’s OG platform reflects a similar dynamic: prediction markets packaged as a standalone financial product. [__[72]__;__[73]__;__[29]__;29]__ and federal court pushback against state regulators (Tennessee). [__[30]__;__[30]__ We have the CFTC chair publicly directing withdrawal of a proposed rule that would prohibit political and sports-related event contracts and signaling clearer rulemaking. [__[74]__;__[75]__;__[16]__;16]__ As more states raise taxes or tighten rules, operators will look for margin levers: parlays, reduced promotional generosity, subscription-like products, and cross-selling into iGaming (where legal).
