We figured that we need to rename \"The Board\" (which is currently for financial oversight) to \"Financial Team\", as we will soon have a new board for the legal entity. In the end our idea was to have the new board refer to an \"assembly\" for all important decisions, and this \"assembly\" would just be all Trusted Contributors in postmarketOS. The Core Contributors team would be dissolved in favor of having several topic-specific teams (a lot of which we already have, such as the infra team). This way we would have a very flat decision structure. The PMCR will be updated soon and discussed further there.
