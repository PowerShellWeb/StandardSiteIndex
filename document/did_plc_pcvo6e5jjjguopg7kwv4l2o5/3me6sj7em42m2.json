Alex Holt was a creative director at a church when a job loss pushed him to start a full-time creative agency. A bad weekend turned out better than what he would have chosen. Since Alex focuses on helping his clients understand the beliefs that shape their business decisions, we thought we’d ask him to talk about what *he* believes. So, to keep things light, we decided to discuss political protests and whether they are a problem or a necessary part of culture. After that, we discussed religion, how one arrives at their beliefs, and how religious institutions become political. Pretty easy topics. We also discussed the creative business, why bigger is not always better, and how the business community is seeking ways to be flexible and cost-effective, leading to more gig workers and allowing entrepreneurs to build lean teams and optimize for quality rather than quantity. Also in this episode, Michael Salemi rubs his warm vacation in Mexico in our faces, and I dealt with some mild technical difficulties as a host who is simultaneously also a producer. Everything worked out great. About The Guest: Alex Holt is a founder and owner at CRTR Studio (https://www.crtrstudio.com/), a brand and identity design studio. He also hosts the podcast, Creative Belief. Mentioned in this episode: We briefly discuss how effective managers are often hated or viewed as controversial, a point which referenced a discussion in the comments section of The Lorem Ipsum, an issue that inspired some of the content of this episode.
