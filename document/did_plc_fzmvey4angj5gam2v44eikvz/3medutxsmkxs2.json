We consider repository comprehension and generation to be inverse processes within a unified cycle: generation expands intent into implementation, while comprehension compresses implementation back into intent. To address this, we propose RPG-Encoder, a framework that generalizes the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) from a static generative blueprint into a unified, high-fidelity representation. RPG-Encoder closes the reasoning loop through three mechanisms: (1) Encoding raw code into the RPG that combines lifted semantic features with code dependencies; (2) Evolving the topology incrementally to decouple maintenance costs from repository scale, reducing overhead by 95.7%; and (3) Operating as a unified interface for structure-aware navigation. In evaluations, RPG-Encoder establishes state-of-the-art localization performance on SWE-bench Verified with 93.7% Acc@5 and exceeds the best baseline by over 10% in localization accuracy on SWE-bench Live Lite. These results highlight our superior fine-grained precision in complex codebases. Furthermore, it achieves 98.5% reconstruction coverage on RepoCraft, confirming RPG’s high-fidelity capacity to mirror the original codebase and closing the loop between intent and implementation.arXiv.orgJane Luo;GitHub - microsoft/RPG-ZeroRepoContribute to microsoft/RPG-ZeroRepo development by creating an account on GitHub.GitHubmicrosoft;AST;Dependency Graph;pic.twitter.com/IyGGWikv2X;February 5, 2026;LinkedIn;@Bryan;@TheYotg;@jhbae1184"}
