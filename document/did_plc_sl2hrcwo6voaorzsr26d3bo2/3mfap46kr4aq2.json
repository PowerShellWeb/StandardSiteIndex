Thousands of peer-reviewed articles at React19[[4;[5;5] After all, most people seem to believe that individual human rights magically disappear from some unannounced inexplicable collective sacrifice in times of war. With the agenda-setting media erecting the only acceptable cognitive frame[[6;[7;7] slightly better than seasonal flu, the COVID-19 operation required controlled and carefully mediated theatrics[[8;[8], gaslighting campaigns[[9;8], gaslighting campaigns[[9], and major marketers of the narrative in mainstream culture to inflate case numbers[[10;[9], and major marketers of the narrative in mainstream culture to inflate case numbers[[10],[[11;9], and major marketers of the narrative in mainstream culture to inflate case numbers[[10],[[11],[[12;[10],[[11],[[12] as a means of agitating emotions and maintaining optimum levels of public hysteria.

The operation demonstrated the power in the practice of perception management at its finest.[[13] Maybe the most salient case of synthetic hysteria was COVID’s body-count inflation in the United Kingdom, in the cultural context that saw retired human resources (pensioners) as a major economic drain no longer sustainable for profit extraction and no longer capable of production but fit, instead, for permanent retirement. It is hardly surprising in the larger political climate, so long feigning concern about manufactured fears over “population”[[14;[15;15] reminds us, furthermore, of the curious rise in recent years of state-approved assisted suicide “across the world”,[[16;[16] which may also explain the bizarre orders given during the COVID operation to administer morphine and midazolam and to withdraw resuscitation[[17;16] which may also explain the bizarre orders given during the COVID operation to administer morphine and midazolam and to withdraw resuscitation[[17],[[18;[17],[[18], often without family consultation, to the unconscious or incapacitated in care homes.
