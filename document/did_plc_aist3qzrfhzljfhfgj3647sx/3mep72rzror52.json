Already our user research shows participants are increasingly comfortable with voice, using it as a high-bandwidth, low-structure input mode, dictating thoughts or instructions to then process with language models. I expect this usage to expand over time, as we design systems specifically for it[[4];[5];[6];6]. First we interviewed computer users to identify problems that presented themselves as fundamental to the computer use generally, then zeroed in on specific knowledge worker use-cases. We combined insights from these interviews with our own forecasts of technology trends (especially around voice input and local models), researched prior art, and watched a bunch of sci-fi. Then we began sketching the first concepts and iterating on our designs with user feedback, finally partnering with [Territory Studio;Apple Knowledge Navigator concept;Mercury OS;Jason Yuan;Desktop Neo;Lennart Ziburski;Her;Matt Webb;Scott Jenson;here;↩︎;The Design of Everyday Things;↩︎;Rong et al., 2025;Radford et al., 2022;↩︎;MacRumours;↩︎;↩︎;↩︎"}
