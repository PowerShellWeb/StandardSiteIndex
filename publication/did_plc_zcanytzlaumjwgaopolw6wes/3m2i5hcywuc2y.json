{"name":"Liberatory Computing","atUri":"at://did:plc:zcanytzlaumjwgaopolw6wes/site.standard.publication/3m2i5hcywuc2y","description":"We live under a capitalist mode of computing. The tools, languages, techniques, and assumptions of digital systems are structured by economic forces that shape not just what we can do, but what we can imagine doing. By separating production from use, producing inflexible software, and slicing up computing into siloed apps, your agency is held back by a tech industry that profits from a population rendered computationally passive.\n\nWe seek to catalyze discontent with the state of computing by understanding the roles of production, labor, and power in shaping the foundations of digital systems.","url":"https://libcomp.leaflet.pub"}
